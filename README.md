## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive fake news detection system that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and metadata analysis to identify misinformation across multiple modalities. By analyzing text content, associated images, and publication metadata, the system provides a robust approach to combating the spread of fake news.

### Key Features

- **Multimodal Analysis**: Combines text, image, and metadata analysis for comprehensive detection
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Utilizes state-of-the-art models for each modality
- **Explainable AI**: Provides interpretable results to understand why content is flagged
- **Modular Design**: Allows for easy updates and improvements to individual components

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for training)
- Git LFS (for managing large dataset files)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detector.git
   cd fake-news-detector
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download datasets (scripts provided in the data directory):
   ```
   python scripts/data_collection/download_datasets.py
   ```

## Data Sources

This project uses the following publicly available datasets:

### Text Datasets
- [LIAR](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip): 12.8K human-labeled short statements from PolitiFact
- [FakeNewsNet](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet): News content from GossipCop and PolitiFact
- [PHEME](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PHEME_dataset_for_Rumour_Detection_and_Veracity_Classification/6392078): Twitter rumors and non-rumors

### Image Datasets
- [MediaEval Verifying Multimedia Use](https://github.com/MKLab-ITI/image-verification-corpus): Images from tweets with verification labels
- [FakeNewsNet](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet): Images associated with news articles

### Metadata Datasets
- Publication dates, source information, and engagement metrics from the above datasets

## Development Roadmap

The project development is organized into 5 phases:

1. **Project Setup & Data Collection** (Weeks 1-3)
2. **Feature Engineering & Baseline Models** (Weeks 4-7)
3. **Advanced Modeling & Integration** (Weeks 8-12)
4. **Interpretability & Evaluation** (Weeks 13-15)
5. **Portfolio Presentation & Deployment** (Weeks 16-17)

Current Status: Phase 1 - Project Setup & Data Collection
